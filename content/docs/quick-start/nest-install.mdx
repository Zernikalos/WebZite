import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have completed all steps in the [Installing Zernikalos](/docs/quick-start/zernikalos-install) guide.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone Required Repositories

First, you'll need to clone two essential repositories:

```bash
# Clone ZKBuilder
git clone https://gitlab.com/zernikalos/zkbuilder.git

# Clone Nest Backend
git clone https://gitlab.com/zernikalos/nest.git
```

### 2. Build the repositories

<Callout type="warn">
It is recommended to use PNPM package manager for Nest, as npm currently has issues with the defined workspace.
</Callout>

Build the ZkBuilder project:

```bash
cd zkbuilder
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

And then perform the very same operation for nest:

```bash
cd ../nest
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### 3. Launch the Nest application

You can start the app in dev build mode using:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Or using the compiled version (it will take longer to be launched):

```bash
pnpm run start
```

If everything has succeeded you will be able to see the Nest App being launched in your desktop:
